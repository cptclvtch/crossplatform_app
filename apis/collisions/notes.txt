SETUP:
- build scene                       <- physics API, using collision API
    - build bvh

LOOP:
- apply forces/torques              <- physics API
- integrate                         <- physics API
- broad phase                       <- collision API
    - updating/reconstructing bvh
    - contact generation
- iterate over contact list         <- collision API
    - do narrow phase
- contact resolution                <- physics API

//TODO decide what a scene is and how scene composition/syncing would work
