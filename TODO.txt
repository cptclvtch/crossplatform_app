- check sdl, tcc and nuklear licensing ()
   - SDL2 (zlib license)
   - Nuklear GUI (Public Domain)
   - TCC (GNU Lesser General Public License) (MIT license possible with https://github.com/absop/Tinycc)
- learn multi-threading and try it in C
   - semaphores
   - mutex
- learn dlls

- test compilation on osx and linux
   - copy libraries into build folders

Notes:
- consider installing TCC through a package manager (git clone git://repo.or.cz/tinycc.git ???)
- forcing people to use TCC might be a problem since it will force them to use an old, subpar C standard, many libraries might be unusable

What I expect people to do with it:
- modify it (TODO: create abstraction layer)
- build executables (DONE using build script)
- programmatically generate new project (TODO: figure out commenting and uncommenting of app_configuration.c)
- update the template (DONE by redownloading it)
